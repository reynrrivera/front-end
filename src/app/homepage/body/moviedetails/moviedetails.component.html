  Across a wide range of businesses, face recognition technology has become a very effective and adaptable instrument in the current day. This technology has significant advantages over traditional ways of monitoring students, making it an invaluable resource for educators and administrators. As we all know, during online quizzes and exams, there is no guarantee that the students are the ones answering the questions. To reduce this or prevent this, the researchers propose an application that will verify the studentâ€™s presence while taking an online academic activity, with the help of a face recognition algorithm, the researchers will be able to ensure that only the recognized students are the ones answering the activities thus preventing academic misconduct from being committed.
